\title{Generates \code{\link{prior.class}} objects.}
\usage{
prior(type.prior, opt.prior, log = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{type.prior}{the vector of the prior types selected. For example type.prior=c("gaussian","gamma")}

\item{opt.prior}{list of the hyperparameters relatives to the prior selected. If the first prior selected is
Gaussian, the hyperparameters would be the mean and the standard deviation. See Details for precisions.}

\item{log}{(default=TRUE) if the log value is wanted or not.}
}
\value{
\code{prior} returns a \code{\link{prior.class}} object. Two main methods are available:
\itemize{\item{plot()}{ display the probability density of the prior}
\item{print()}{ return the main information concerning the prior distribution}}
}
\description{
\code{prior} is a function that generates a \code{\link{prior.class}} containing information about one or
several priors. When several priors are selected, the function \code{prior} return a list of \code{\link{prior.class}}.
}
\details{
The densities implemented are defined as follow
\itemize{
\item{The Gaussian density:
\deqn{f(x)=1/(\sigma*\sqrt(2\pi))exp{-1/2*((x-\mu)/\sigma)^2}}
where \strong{\eqn{\mu}} and \strong{\eqn{\sigma}} (the mean and the standard deviation)
are the two hyperparameters. The vector \eqn{c(\mu,\sigma^2)} is the one looked for in opt.prior.}
\item{The Gamma density:
\deqn{f(x)=1/(k^a*\Gamma(a))*x^(a-1)*exp(-(x/k))}
where \strong{\eqn{a}} and \strong{\eqn{k}} (the shape and the scale)
are the two hyperparameters. The vector \eqn{c(a,k)} is the one looked for in opt.prior.}
\item{The Uniform density:
\deqn{f(x)=1/(b-a)}
where \strong{\eqn{a}} and \strong{\eqn{b}} (the upper and the lower bound)
are the two hyperparameters. The vector \eqn{c(a,b)} is the one looked for in opt.prior.}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
#### Only one prior is wanted
## For a Gaussian Prior
gaussian <- prior(type.prior="gaussian",opt.prior=list(c(0.5,0.001)))
plot(gaussian)

#### For several priors
priors <- prior(type.prior=c("gaussian","gamma"),opt.prior=list(c(0.5,0.001),c(5,1)))
plot(priors$Prior1)
plot(priors$Prior2)
